So Long: A small 2D game
-
The project is part of the 42 Cursus and it aims to introduce us to graphics through the MiniLibx. This püroject handles window management, event handling, colors, textures and so forth.

Game Rules
-
• The player’s goal is to collect every collectible present on the map, then escape
chosing the shortest possible route.

• The W, A, S, and D, alternatively, the arrow keys must be used to move the main character.

• The player should be able to move in these 4 directions: up, down, left, right.

• The player should not be able to move into walls.

• At every move, the current number of movements must be displayed in the shell.

• You have to use a 2D view (top-down or profile).

• The game doesn’t have to be real time.

Graphic Management
-
• Your program has to display the image in a window.

• The management of your window must remain smooth (changing to another window, minimizing, and so forth).

• Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program in a clean way.

• Clicking on the cross on the window’s frame must close the window and quit the
program in a clean way.

Map
-
• The map has to be constructed with 3 components: walls, collectibles, and free
space.

• The map can be composed of only these 5 characters:

0 for an empty space,

1 for a wall,

C for a collectible,

E for a map exit,

P for the player’s starting position

• The map must contain 1 exit, at least 1 collectible, and 1 starting position to
be valid.

• The map must be rectangular.

• The map must be closed/surrounded by walls. If it’s not, the program must return
an error.

• You have to check if there’s a valid path in the map.

• You must be able to parse any kind of map, as long as it respects the above rules.

• If any misconfiguration of any kind is encountered in the file, the program must
exit in a clean way, and return "Error\n" followed by an explicit error message of
your choice.

FYI I made square maps invalid due to aesthetic preference.
